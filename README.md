## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation for our website was to be able to leave movie reviews in order to inspire other people to watch the movie or to deter them from watching the movie.
The reason for creating this project was because we wanted to give our users a voice and have them be able to give their own personal thoughts about a specific movie they saw.
One problem our website solves is that it helps users decide wether or not they wants to watch a movie or not.
A few things we learned is how to deploy our website onto heroku. We also learned how to use .env files to conceal personal information that we dont want shared.
## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
