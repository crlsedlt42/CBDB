## Description

The motivation for our website was to be able to leave movie reviews in order to inspire other people to watch the movie or to deter them from watching the movie.
The reason for creating this project was because we wanted to give our users a voice and have them be able to give their own personal thoughts about a specific movie they saw.
One problem our website solves is that it helps users decide wether or not they wants to watch a movie or not.
A few things we learned is how to deploy our website onto heroku. We also learned how to use .env files to conceal personal information that we dont want shared.
